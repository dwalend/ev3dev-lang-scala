For Cargo Connect


Main manipulator

Front, mostly under the main deck of the robot - Build a retractable fork that is almost on the mat. Generally use it to rest shipping containers on. Retract the fork to gently release a shipping container. It can also push inside equipment to place crates higher. Drive a hinged, channeled beam forward. At the end of its run drive that beam upward on a track to lift - to get crates out of the sorting center

Right side, high - Power takeoff with axis running front-to-back, mostly to build manipulator arms. Specialize for the cargo plane as needed, then generalize from there to push and pull different models

    


Ship Sortie

Start with: 3 grey containers in home, 1 in cargo plane, 3 in sorting center, 1 (chest) on mat
End with: 2 grey containers and the chest in home, 2 grey containers on the ship, 3 in the sorting center

The arm is extra-specialized
     
* Truck on board

The front edge of the arm on the right side pushes the truck to the bridge footing

* Drawbridge

The front edge of the arm on the right side closes the west end of the drawbridge. 

* Ship Cargo

Slide a brace for the ship, with two containers on top in the back - a "portable loading dock". The brace has catches for the fork. The back is the height of the ship deck, the front one stud lower. The robot inserts the brace, then pushes forward with the fork to push sliding parts inside the brace to deposit the crates on the deck

The robot pivots, lowers its arm, and slides the cargo crane along its track

* Little truck

The robot lowers its arm to drive the little truck forward

* Chest

The robot plows the blue chest into home

* Cargo Plane

The robot backs past the cargo plane and opens it with it's arm. Dangly bits on the arm scrape the grey container into home. 

* Helicopter

Scrape the packet off the helicopter with that big arm. Recover the robot.


    
Blade Sortie

Not messing with containers this sortie.

The arm is specialized for handling the windmill blade. It may have an extra beam sticking out to back-hand the drawbridge

* Blade 

Use a long side-loader to carry the blade past the chicken and lower it into the blue bracket. Drive straight. Raise the arm out of the way

* Package delivery

Use a lower "portable loading dock" with the same sort of sliding mechanism insde to push the package onto the porch. Fine to leave the equipment. 

Drive the robot home. Recover the robot


Train and Sorting Center Sortie

Start with: 2 grey containers and the chest in home, 2 grey containers on the ship, 3 in the sorting center
End with: The chest in home, 2 grey containers on the train, 2 grey containers on the ship, 1 in the sorting center, 1 in blue circle, 1 in green circle

* Truck From Home

Use the arm to slide the second truck forward and hook it to the first truck.

* Train Cargo

Another "portable loading dock" - attaches to the train, not the tracks - this one wide enough to deliver a container to each car on the train. 

* Train Repair

Back pivot on right wheel, then use the arm to repair the tracks. Drive forward

* Helicopter

Bump the helicopter to release the food packet.

* Train Driving

Lower an arm to catch the train, then slide the robot backward to move the grain.

* Sorting center

Pivot to face the sorting center. Use the fork to pick up the green container, then the blue container

* Blue circle

Retract the fork to drop off the blue container in the blue circle

* Drawbridge

Drive backward west. Use the arm to lower the drawbridge

* Green circle

Drive forward to the green circle. Retract the fork all the way to drop off the green container

* Little plane

Back out of the green circle. Use the arm to move the little plane. Head for home. Recover the robot.








Parking Sortie

Start with: The chest in home, 2 grey containers on the train, 2 grey containers on the ship, 1 in the sorting center, 1 in blue circle, 1 in green circle


* Blue Chest, Helicopter package, and sculpture to Cargo Connect Logo circle

    Slide the whole works in the fork, then retract the fork


* Precision Parking
    
    Wiggle in and wall-follow

    Stop precisely by putting a tool on the motor to tap the yellow plate

    Maybe rotate an arm up to hold up the black panel


* Rotate Motor

    With the tool used to stop for precision parking
