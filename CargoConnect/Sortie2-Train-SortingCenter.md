Train and Sorting Center Sortie

Start with: 2 grey containers and the chest in home, 2 grey containers on the ship, 3 in the sorting center
End with: The chest in home, 2 grey containers on the train, 2 grey containers on the ship, 1 in the sorting center, 1 in blue circle, 1 in green circle


The arm is modestly specialized
* Press down train tracks to repair the tracks - this may be a complex linkage - scissors? 
* Push the train forwards - should be simple but long
* Knock down the bridge - should be simple

Robot set up

* Home in the chest area must be clear to retrieve the robot
* Run Load Train Sortie to extend tines slightly
* Attach the track spike to the robot's tines
* Load train trey with two crates and attach to the robot
* Attach train repair arm, vertical position, to power-take-off
* Use the -45 jig to aim right color sensor at the helicopter road
* Run Train Sortie

Route

* From start to truck-on-brdige
** Leave start at -45
** -45 gyro drive to pick up line with right side color sensor
** Hybred gyro-line follow (right side color sensor) to bend in line - measure from pond spur with left side color sensor
** Forward-pivot on right wheel to 0
** Pick up line with right side color sensor
** Hybred gyro-line follow (right side color sensor) to 


latch truck on bridge
** raise arm to bridge-catching height
** Hybred gyro-line follow to bump bridge (right side color sensor) - measure from parking line (left color sensor)
** Raise arm to vertical - out of way



--------

* Truck From Home (maybe do this in sortie 1)

Use the arm to slide the second truck forward and hook it to the first truck.

* Train Cargo

Another "portable loading dock" - attaches to the train, not the tracks - this one wide enough to deliver a container to each car on the train. 

* Train Repair

Back pivot on right wheel, then use the arm to repair the tracks. Drive forward

* Helicopter

Bump the helicopter to release the food packet.

* Train Driving

Lower an arm to catch the train, then slide the robot backward to move the grain.

* Sorting center

Pivot to face the sorting center. Use the fork to pick up the green container, then the blue container

* Blue circle

Retract the fork to drop off the blue container in the blue circle

* Drawbridge

Drive backward west. Use the arm to lower the drawbridge

* Green circle

Drive forward to the green circle. Retract the fork all the way to drop off the green container

* Little plane (Do this in sortie 1)

Back out of the green circle. Use the arm to move the little plane. Head for home. Recover the robot.
