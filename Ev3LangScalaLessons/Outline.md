1 Clear vs Cryptic
    Let your code tell a clear story
    Set up the EV3 (Cryptic)
    Set up your computer (Cryptic)
    Get the ev3 and your computer to talk (Cryptic)
    First Scala Hello World Program on the EV3
    (introduce sorties and missions)
    (Introduce robot and components)
    (Chasis)
2 Code Tells a Story - Objects, Enums, and Methods
    A story about a robot needs `object Robot`
    And the robot should have some things and do some things
    println()
    JarRunner - cryptic version (Cryptic)
    Drive around a bit
    Always stop
    (Analyze missions)
    (Fixed attachments)
3 Your own methods, with Motors and Tachometry
    Do what you intend - tell your story
        Defining new methods with def 
    Motor as a sensor
        Display that on the LCD
    Programming a motor
        The minimal set of options
        Different ways to stop
    Geometry of Tank Drive
        Go forward a fixed distances - Degrees to straight-line distance traveled via Wheel diameter
        Degrees to distance pivoted - Turning radius
        Driving in an arc    
    Forward-to-Reverse - backlash
    More motor programming settings (Cryptic)
    (Wheels and tires)
    (Motorized attachments)
    (Pick key missions and sketch sorties)
4 A Menu of Methods
    The LCD
    The LEDs
    Sound
    Lists of things
    Menu of LED lights
    Reload! (Cryptic)
    (Collision-powered attachments)
    (Assign key missions to sorties)
    (Deconstruct robot rough-out)
5 Timing and Interrupting
    Display even more - time and battery
    Concurrent code (Cryptic)
        volatile vars
        synchronized
        This is terrible, but works OK
        Other options
    One thread can stop another
    Interrupting the time loop
    (Attachment sockets)
    (Equipment)
    (Mechanical attachments and equipment)
7 Sensors
    Display sensor values on the LCD
    Go forward to black line
    Calibrating sensors
        Color sensor
        Watch the Earth turn with a gyroscope (Set up in advance)
        Gyroscope (Cryptic)
    Gyro pivot
    Ultrasonic
    All the sensor modes (Cryptic)
    (Rough routes for sorties)
    (Sensor placement)
8 Higher-order methods and Feedback
    Go forward until X
    Feedback
    Gyro turn - a more general form
    (Plan routes for sorties)
    (Build main motorized attachments)
9 Analyzing a Feedback Loop
    Sensors, motors, and timing
    The JVM is weird... Warm up! (Cryptic)
    Feedback loop - general form
    (Perform Key Missions)
10 Your own feedback loops
    Proportional control
    Gyro drive straight
    General drive straight
    Line following
    Predictive control
    Gyro-assisted line following
    Gyro arc drive with predictive control
11 Moves, Waypoints, Sorties, and Everything
12 Telling the Story
