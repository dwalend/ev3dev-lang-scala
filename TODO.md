Refine the LCD code even more - it's still really slow

Is there another option? C interface maybe? https://github.com/theZiz/ev3c ( http://ziz.gp2x.de/ev3c_documentation/files/include/ev3c_lcd-h.html ) looks promising
                        
Or immitate theZiz' work, do it as almost-pure-scala. (Will still need NativeFile for some of that.)
